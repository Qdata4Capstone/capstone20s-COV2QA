# This Github Host Students' Final Project Deliverables from 2020 Fall UVa CS Course: Machine Learning, Math Foundations and Good Use

### [2020 Fall UVa CS Course: Machine Learning, Math Foundations and Good Use](https://qiyanjun.github.io/2020f-UVA-CS-MachineLearningDeep//About/)

### Objective of the course: To help students get capable in building machine learning tools (not just a tool user!!!) 
### Key results: (1) to build multiple machine learning methods from scratch, (2) to understand complex machine learning methods at the source code level and (3) to produce one machine learning project on cutting-edge data applications with health or social impacts or with cutting-edge engineering impacts on deep learning benchmarking libraries.
